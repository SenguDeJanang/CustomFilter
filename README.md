# CustomFilter
Custom Filter is a image processing tool that can do unique things such as bleaching (which only leaves the shading, without the influence of the color of the object. it does however need the picture with color but no shading.), and strict palette application (which makes every pixel in the picture have the closest color in the palette as their own, and the user can set the palette)
